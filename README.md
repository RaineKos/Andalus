# Andalus

Compute freely.

## What is Andalus?

Andalus is a completely free and open-source operating system for Phonebloks devices. It aims to be **totally user-controlled.** This means that users will be able to do the following:

* Contribute ideas, code, and graphics to the project.
* Guide the development of the project.
* Modify Andalus completely to their needs with ease.

The latter three goals are summarized by the project motto: "Compute freely." This motto can be remembered as an abridged version of our three goals.

The Andalus project is maintained by the Andalus team at Amoveo Labs. While anyone is free to contribute, the Andalus team decides which pull-requests get merged into the repository. This ensures that the repository remains clean, contribution-friendly, and build-ready.

The Andalus project is license under the GNU General Public License v2. This license is also used by our core dependency, the Linux kernel. The license text can be found in the [LICENSE](https://github.com/Amoveo-Labs/Andalus/blob/master/LICENSE) file.

## Notice

This README, just like the project it is assigned to, is in its early construction stage. It will be modified as the project is developed.

Thank you for your interest in the project.
